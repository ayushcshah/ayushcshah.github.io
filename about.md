Hi I am Graduated from Florida Institute of Technology as Masters in Science in Computer Science and love to develop iOS Applications.

In spare time, I like to explore new technologies and research on cutting edge technologies (Web Development Frameworks, DIY Raspberry Pi). I also make time for my personal pet Projects.
